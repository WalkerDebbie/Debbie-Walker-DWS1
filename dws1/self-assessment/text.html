		<h1> The Giant Squid </h1>
			
		<dl>
			<dt><em>Giant squid</em> (genus:<b><i>Architeuthis</b></i>):</dt> <!--Definition lists-->
				<dd> A deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <em>Architeuthidae</em>, represented by as many as eight species.</dd>
		</dl>
			<p> Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <i>Deep-sea gigantism)</i>: recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
						
			<p> On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title = "(Museum of Nature and Science)" >NMNS</abbr> <abbr title = "(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association)">OWA</abbr> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <b>NMNS</b> and <b>OWA</b> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
